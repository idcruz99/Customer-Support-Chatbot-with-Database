# Customer-Support-Chatbot-with-Database
<h1>Purpose</h1>
The intent of this project is to solve a business need for a music production software called FL Studio, which can be downloaded at imageline.com. Currently, the website has an outdated customer support system consisting of a FAQs tab and a ticket submission tab. While this system functions properly, it could be a lot faster and more accessible for the user. To solve this business need, I created a live customer support chatbot that is able to answer most questions from the user instantly, and is even able to submit a user-created ticket to send to imageline's CRM database through an API link. 
<h1>Tools Used</h1>
Live Customer Support Chatbot created on https://botpress.com/

CRM Database: SQL Server Management Studio 19

<h1>Planning Phase</h1>
Before coding the chatbot and creating the tables for the database, I had to make an outline to plan out the main objectives of this project. To accurately break each stage down to ensure everything goes according to plan, I created a Work Breakdown Structure so I can follow it as each stage is completed.
