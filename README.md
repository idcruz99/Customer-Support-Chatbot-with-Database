# Customer-Support-Chatbot-with-Database
<h1>Purpose</h1>
The intent of this project is to solve a business need for a music production software called FL Studio, which can be downloaded at imageline.com. Currently, the website has an outdated customer support system consisting of a FAQs tab and a ticket submission tab. While this system functions properly, it could be a lot faster and more accessible for the user. To solve this business need, I created a live customer support chatbot that is able to answer most questions from the user instantly, and is even able to submit a user-created ticket to send to Imageline's CRM database on SQL. 
<h1>Tools Used</h1>
Live Customer Support Chatbot created on https://botpress.com/

CRM Database: SQL Server Management Studio 19

<h1>Planning Phase</h1>
Before coding the chatbot and creating the tables for the database, I had to make an outline to plan out the main objectives of this project. To accurately break each stage down to ensure everything goes according to plan, I created a Work Breakdown Structure so I can follow it as each stage is completed.

<h3>Create Tables on SQL</h3>

<h3>Execute query to show ticket status with corresponding customer username</h3>

<h1>Deployment Phase</h1>

Now that the tables have been created, I needed to populate them using fake data as well as real data from user-testing. I did this to show the database's usability and functionalities.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the tables filled, the database is ready to be used with the chatbot. To make the chatbot, I used Botpress to create the conversation flow to be able to capture the user submitted tickets to then be stored into the database. The live customer support chatbot can be used by clicking this link: https://mediafiles.botpress.cloud/253a7d7a-2211-4a0c-9016-ea52787e5bdb/webchat/bot.html 

<h3>Chatbot Conversation Flow</h3>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order for the chatbot to only derive its answers from ImageLine's website, I had to edit its knowledge base. It is coded to answer any questions from their website, and if the user needs to submit a ticket, it will recognize that and be able to capture the user's ticket request and username to store it into the database on SQL.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With both the database and chatbot complete and fully functioning, all that is needed is to transfer data from user-submitted tickets into the database. To see the tikets with their corresponding customers on SQL, I executed the following query below:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<h1>Closing</h1>

To make sure everything was running smoothly, I conducted user acceptance testing to perform several different tasks using the software to ensure quality. This can be found in the word doc uploaded to this repository. 

The success of this project was very dependent on the accuracy of coding the conversation flow for the chatbot, as well as properly formatting the tables on SQL. This required troubleshooting, making adjustments, and monitoring all steps needed to ensure success. Overall, this system is a great replacement for an outdated customer support system because it is faster, much more user-friendly, and overall more reliable.
